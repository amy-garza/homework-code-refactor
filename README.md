HMWK 1: Horiseon Code Refactor

This assignment tasked me to review existing code and refactor it to: (1) organize the semantic structure of the HTML elements; (2) create efficiencies in the CSS; (3) meet web accessibility standards; and, (4) follow the Scout Rule - Always leave the code you are editing a little cleaner than you found it.

This being my first time to refactor code (ever), I learned a lot through trial and error, googling and continuously reminding myself to work top-down and see the page as a bunch of boxes. I focused heavily on the HTML portion of this assignment and know there is plenty of room to consolidate more of the CSS stylesheet than I addressed here. The code is cleaner than I found it, but I certainly look forward to improving my code refactoring abilities in time and with ongoing study and practice.
